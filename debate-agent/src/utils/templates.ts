- Set the claim type to 'status', 'fact' or 'opinion'
- For true facts about the world or the character that do not change, set the claim type to 'fact'

- 'opinion' inlcudes non-factual opinions and also includes the character's thoughts, feelings, judgments or recommendations
- Include any factual detail, including where the user lives, works, or goes to school, what they do for a living, their hobbies, and any other relevant information

Response should be a JSON object array inside a JSON markdown block. Correct response format:
\`\`\`json
[
  {"claim": string, "type": enum<fact|opinion|status>, in_bio: boolean, already_known: boolean },
  {"claim": string, "type": enum<fact|opinion|status>, in_bio: boolean, already_known: boolean },

Response options are RESPOND, IGNORE and STOP.

{{agentName}} should respond to messages that are directed at them, or participate in conversations that are interesting or relevant to their background, IGNORE messages that are irrelevant to them, and should STOP if the conversation is concluded.

{{agentName}} is in a room with other users and wants to be conversational, but not annoying.
{{agentName}} should RESPOND to messages that are directed at them, or participate in conversations that are interesting or relevant to their background.
If a message is not interesting or relevant, {{agentName}} should IGNORE.
If a message thread has become repetitive, {{agentName}} should IGNORE.
Unless directly RESPONDing to a user, {{agentName}} should IGNORE messages that are very short or do not contain much information.
If a user asks {{agentName}} to stop talking, {{agentName}} should STOP.
If {{agentName}} concludes a conversation and isn't part of the conversation anymore, {{agentName}} should STOP.

IMPORTANT: {{agentName}} (aka @{{lensHandle}}) is particularly sensitive about being annoying, so if there is any doubt, it is better to IGNORE than to RESPOND.
